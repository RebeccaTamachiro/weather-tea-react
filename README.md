# Weather Tea

**Weather Tea** is my first Front End Development project and it consists of a weather forecast app that also provides different suggestions for tea blends and related beverages according to the temperature that returns after the user searches for a specific city. 

The app was [originally built in Vanilla JavaScript](https://github.com/RebeccaTamachiro/Weather_Tea_Project) and so in this version, as I coded it for my final project within *SheCodes React Workshop*, I've also added a spin-off called **Weather Snack** mostly to experiment with conditional rendering and other possibilities when using React Components.
